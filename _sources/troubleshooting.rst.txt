Troubleshooting
===============
This section describes some common issues that can arise and possible solutions.

Issue #1
--------
<Description>
There are parts of the labs that require us to further our learning outside of the class time and it was difficult to understand the material without these sources
<Solution>
Look at these resources whenever possible and available

Issue #2
--------
<Description>
There are going to be parts or sections that just will not click in my brain.
<Solution>
Do not be afraid to ask for help

Issue #3
--------
<Description>
Lose of information/data that I have created within the branches of the labs that I have occassionally lost
<Solution>
Finish the labs as much as I possibly can in one go, then upload/commit the progress I have ASAP as to not lose my progress as if it is not merged I can still change and receive it
